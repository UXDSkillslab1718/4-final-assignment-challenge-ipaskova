            <h3>Short description of the section:</h3>
        <p>
            My best projects are Interaction design I and Interaction design II. I am putting two assignments of the ones that are my best, as the course HTML-CSS was in period 1.2 and now I am resitting it after period 2.1. So, until now I have good works, but from this period are one of my best ones and I would like to show them.
        </p>
        <h3>Period 1.2 - Interaction design I</h3>
        <h4>Application for "UK cinemas"</h4>
        <h4>Group work</h4>
        <p>The task of this assignment was to create a design of website/application for a company named UK cinemas. We had to read about the company and collect information, fill a list of requirements, iterate for idea, which will make the company interesting for the users. </p>

        <h4>Iteration 1</h4>
        <p> This is one of our first iterations. First we decided to diverge on different topics and add ideas in order to clean our mind and get to the final one.</p>
        <img class = "iteration1 - narrow" src="iteration1.jpg" alt="iteration1" width= 300>

        <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
        <p> Secondly, after a lot fo eliminations and evaluations, we decided to choose this idea - interactive seat for the users. Our next task was to start creating the application/website.</p>
        <img class = "iteration2 - narrow" src="iteration2.jpg" alt="iteration2" width= 200> 

        <h4>Final iteration</h4>
        <p>This is our last iteration. We decided to design an application, because it is more convinient when you go to the cinema. Everyone has their phones with them and can control the seat, whenever they want.</p>

         <h3>Period 2.1 - Interaction design II</h3>
        <h4>Redesign of the "The Dutch Store"</h4>
        <h4>Group work</h4>
        <p>The second assignment I decided to put is in Interaction design II. The task of this assignment was to make a redesign of a poplar online web shop called "The Dutch Store". My partner and I gained some insights after reading a personna, which we had and made a detailed expert review of the website. We wrote requirements, which were the base of our design. </p>

        <h4>Iteration 1</h4>
        <p>This is our first iteration - wireframes. Every designer should start from somewhere, when making a design or redesign. Wireframes are great tool for this. We made them on paper, as this was the requirement of the assignment. We decided a lot of things and set a goal - make the website as much as possible useful for the users. Besides this, if we are capable of course, make it look good and combine the colors, fonts, etc, with the theme of the website and more specific - the Netherlands.</p>

         <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
        <p>Our second task was to make a styletile. Choosing a program, which we are going to make the design with and make the styletile there. We decided for a specific fonts, size of the fonts, buttons, header, footer etc.</p>
         <img class = "styletile - narrow" src="styletile.png" alt="styletile" width= 400>

         <h4>Final Iteration</h4>
        <p>For the final part of the assignment - we split the work - I started making the design of the homepage, overview page and detailed page and my partner did the checkput procedure. Everyone of us had to make 4 screens and add description to them. I am proud of what I made and this is the reason I wanted to put this assignment so much here!</p>
